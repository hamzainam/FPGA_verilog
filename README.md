# RISC Processor Verilog Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a simplified RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor using Verilog. The design emphasizes clarity and educational value, making it suitable for both learning and demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **8-bit Harvard architecture**: Supports separate memory spaces for instructions and data.
- **Basic instruction set**: Includes arithmetic, logical, and control instructions.
- **3-stage pipeline**: Fetch, Decode, and Execute stages for instruction processing.
- **Testbench included**: A comprehensive testbench to verify the functionality of the processor.
